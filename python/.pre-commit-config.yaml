  # Currently disabled mypy precommit hook until we figured how to make it work properly (see
  # `typecheck` in the makefile).
  #
  # We do not use the standard pre-commit/mirrors-mypy, as it comes with opinionated defaults
  # (like --ignore-missing-imports) and is difficult to configure to run with the config specified
  # for the project. Instad we use a custom hook, which uses the local system (i.e. whatever
  # python (virtual) env is currently active, and runs type checking as per the make command
  #- repo: local
