# Adding Gathers to Phiphi

This document outlines the steps to add a new gather type to Phiphi.

When adding a new gather it is recommended to follow the steps outlined here while using one of the
other gathers, such as
[`apify_facebook_posts`](python/projects/phiphi/phiphi/api/projects/gathers/apify_facebook_posts/),
as a example for the changes and conventions.

Currently there are only Apify gathers, but in the future there might be other gather types. These
steps are then specific to Apify gathers.
