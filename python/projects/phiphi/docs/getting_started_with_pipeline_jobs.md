# Getting Started with Pipeline Jobs

The PhiPhi Pipeline Jobs are a set of prefect flows (python functions) that can be used to collect
and process social media data. They are designed to be used by developers who want to do their own
social media data collection and processing. This is best for developers that are working on just a
couple of projects and they want to process these data locally.

Unfortunately we didn't yet get the time to make this documentation. Please reach out to us or give
it a go your self. We would love to see someone else make/use this.
