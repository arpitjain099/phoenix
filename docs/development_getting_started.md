# Development Getting Started

Welcome to the development guide for contributors! This document outlines the steps necessary to
set up your development environment for working on the project. Our project leverages a local
Kubernetes (k8s) cluster for the development of the full system, while sub-projects may have
smaller-scale set-ups for more focused development.

This approach allows you to test changes in a controlled environment that closely mimics
production. For sub-projects, smaller-scale set-ups are available and can be used for more specific
development tasks. See sub folders for more information on this.

Thank you for contributing to our project, and happy coding!
