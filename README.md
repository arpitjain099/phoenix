# Phoenix

An open-source social media analysis platform for peacebuilders.

Phoenix is a powerful, multi-tier platform that enables peacebuilders and analysts to monitor,
analyze, and visualize social media data for conflict prevention and peacebuilding efforts.

## Where to start

Phoenix offers several components tailored to different users' needs, from peacebuilders to
experienced software engineers. You can choose from three primary levels of interaction:

### 1. Platform

The **Phoenix Platform** is a full-stack web application providing a user-friendly interface to manage
configurations, collect and process social media data, and visualize results. It is designed for
peacebuilders and analysts (not deep in the code) who need a comprehensive toolset to monitor and
analyze social media activity.

* **Best for**: A team of engineers that want to offer phoenix to multi users who need a
  full-featured, out-of-the-box solution.
* **Setup complexity**: Highest, but includes the richest features.
* **Getting started**: See the [Platform Quick start](#platform-quick-start) section below.

Build Up also provides a **hosted version** of the platform. Learn more at [Build Up
Phoenix](https://howtobuildup.org/programs/digital-conflict/phoenix/).

### 2. PhiPhi API

The **PhiPhi API** is a RESTful API designed for developers who want to manage configurations,
collect data, and integrate Phoenix with other systems (such as visualization platforms). The API
includes auto-generated documentation via a Swagger web interface that allows developers to explore
and use the API endpoints.

* **Best for**: Developers wanting to manage multiple projects or integrate Phoenix with other
  systems.
* **Setup complexity**: Medium. Requires cloud deployment for practical use.
* **Documentation**: See the [PhiPhi Readme](python/projects/phiphi/README.md) for more
  information.

### 3. PhiPhi Pipeline Jobs

The **PhiPhi Pipeline Jobs** are a set of Python-based Prefect flows for developers who prefer to
collect and process social media data locally. This component is ideal for developers working on a
limited number of projects and is the easiest to set up.

* **Best for**: Developers who want get going quick, can manage their own data collection and
  processing locally.
* **Setup complexity**: Lowest, but requires developers organise configuration.
* **Documentation**: See the [PhiPhi Pipeline Jobs
  Readme](python/projects/phiphi/docs/getting_started_with_pipeline_jobs.md) for setup
  instructions.
